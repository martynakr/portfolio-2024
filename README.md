# Portfolio 2024

Check out the live page [here](http://martynakrol.me/)

This project is my updated portfolio. Apart from having a place w here I can showcase my projects, there are two other reasons I decided to work on it:

-   I've been working as a software developer for over 2 years now - I want the code for this page to represent my current skills level
-   It is FUN - personal projects like this are always a great way to remind myself why I started coding in the first place

## Design Idea

### Canvas element logic explained

### Change log

-   **1 June 2024** - setting up a landing page which links to Github. The main focus for today was getting an understanding of how to work with the HTML canvas element as well as exploring and researching the math logic for bending the line in response to move movements.
